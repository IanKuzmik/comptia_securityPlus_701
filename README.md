My study guide for the CompTia Security+ 701 Exam

Info compiled from free resources online (thank you content creators) as well as from Google AI/ChatGPT 

I've included main.py, which presents the data in quiz form. I used a beefier version in my own studying, but it's an absolute mess. This version is fairly simple, but should still work out of the box by just running main.py from your IDE or terminal interface.

In addition to pretty much memorizing all this data, I scoured Youtube for practice question videos.

Buy yourself a coffee instead though, you deserve it.

Good luck on the exam!
